### License

I'm of the opinion that when someone takes something valuable, like source code, and knowingly and willingly puts it somewhere where literally anyone in the world can view it and grab a copy for themselves, as I have done, they are giving their implicit consent for those people to do so and to use the code however they see fit.  I think the concept of "copyleft" is, quite frankly, borderline insane.  Information wants to be free without reservation, and good things happen when we allow it to be.  But not everyone agrees with that philosophy, and larger organizations like seeing an "official" license, so I digress.

For the sake of simplicity, you may consider all matchbook code to be licensed under the terms of the MIT license.  Or if you prefer, the Apache license.  Or CC BY.  Or any other permissive open-source license (the operative word there being "permissive").  Take your pick.  Basically use this code if you like, otherwise don't.  Though if you use matchbook to build something cool that changes the world, please remember to give credit where credit is due.  And also please tell me about it, so that I can see too.
